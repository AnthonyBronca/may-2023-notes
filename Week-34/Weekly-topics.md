### Recommended things to study


To prepare for your upcoming exam I recommend reviewing the following topics.
Additionally I recommend doing the PA about 3 - 5 times MINIMUM, try to solo build a rock paper scissors terminal game (solution in week-33 day 5 for reference), and going over the a/A open practices for anything you are struggling with. Keep in mind some of those practices may be more 'math/problem solvy' than needed for the test so the PA is a good reference to gauge how tough the questions will be.

    - Indentation
