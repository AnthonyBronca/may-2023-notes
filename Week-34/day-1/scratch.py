names = ["anthony", "andrew", "bill", "edward", "arnold", "charles"]

# Use filter to create a NEW list of names that start with 'a'


# print(a_names)

# ----------------------
# Use map to create a NEW list, where all the names are upper cased


# print(upper_names)


# ----------------------

# use sorted to create a NEW list where names are in alphabetical order


# print(in_order)

# ----------------------

# use sorted with a key to sort in alphetical looking at last letter
# in name istead of first:
# res -> ["edward", "arnold", "bill", "charles", " andrew", "anthony"]
# Hint: Try using a helper func


# print(last_name_order)


# HELP ME SOLVE THIS USING A LAMBDA INSTEAD! ^

# ----------------------

# Use "all" to return true if all the names are lowercased
# Hint: try passing in an advanced list method

# print(all_lowered)

# Use "any" to return False i none of the names start with "J"

# print(any_js)
